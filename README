His codes are too old to work in modern Java environment. And they contain
to many errors.

I singled out the file "SeededKMeans.java", corrected for errors, 
and compiled it, to make it a standalone version of his paper's algorithms.

simply run these three steps:

step 0: replace "../weka-latest/weka.jar" in compile.sh to where your weka.jar locates. 
======	This file can be obtained from the weka page on sourceforge.

step 1:  ./compile.sh
======

step 2:  ./execute.sh
